# Analyze-Fitbit-Fitness-Tracker-data

## created simple dashboard for given problem
<p>WeFit wants its Analytic team to create a dashboard out of this data to present it in
front of their management team.
To do that we will only take the daily activity data and try to create a few charts and
graphs out of it.
1. First use the daily activity data and find the unique id of all the users.
2. Then find the number of days they use their fitness tracker.
3. Use this data to group all the users into Active(>20), moderate(>10,<20) and
light(<10) users.
(for example active user can be the one wearing the gear for more than 20 days)
4. After that find out the mean distance traveled by each user
5. Use this mean distance to group each user into Pro,Intermediate and
beginner.(set criteria by yourself)
6. Then find out the total steps traveled by each user
7. Then find out the calories burned by each user
8. And then find out their fairly active, lightly active and Very active minutes.
9. Repeat all these tasks (1 to 8) with respect to distinct dates (for example find out
unique dates instead of unique id and calculate number of users on that date)</p>
